# SymbioScout Demo Script

## Demo Overview (5-7 minutes)

### Introduction (30 seconds)
"Welcome to SymbioScout, an AI-powered platform that helps urban planners and community activists identify unused urban spaces and generate mini greening projects. Today I'll show you how we can transform a vacant lot in Bangkok into a thriving community garden in just a few minutes."

### Step 1: Site Discovery (1 minute)
1. **Show the map interface**: "Here we have an interactive map of Bangkok showing potential greening opportunities."
2. **Click on the Wat Pho Community Garden Site**: "Our AI has identified this vacant lot adjacent to Wat Pho temple - currently used as informal parking space."
3. **Highlight site details**: "It's 120 square meters with good sun exposure and community access."

### Step 2: AI Plant Recommendations (1.5 minutes)
1. **Click "Generate Greening Plan"**: "Now let's see what our AI recommends for this space."
2. **Show plant recommendations**: "The system has selected native Thai plants including Frangipani trees, Siam Tulip, and Marigolds - all drought-tolerant and pollinator-friendly."
3. **Explain the selection**: "These plants are specifically chosen for Bangkok's tropical climate and will provide multiple benefits."

### Step 3: Impact Analysis (1.5 minutes)
1. **Navigate to Impact Analysis**: "Let's see the environmental benefits of this project."
2. **Highlight key metrics**:
   - "5,000+ liters of stormwater runoff reduction per year"
   - "80+ kg of CO2 sequestration annually"
   - "High biodiversity support with multiple pollinator species"
   - "Significant air quality improvement"

### Step 4: Proposal Generation (2 minutes)
1. **Click "Generate Community Proposal"**: "Now we'll create a professional proposal for stakeholders."
2. **Show the generated proposal**: "Our AI has created a comprehensive proposal including project overview, benefits, and implementation steps."
3. **Demonstrate PDF export**: "This can be downloaded as a PDF and shared with community groups or city officials."

### Conclusion (30 seconds)
"In just a few minutes, we've gone from identifying a vacant lot to having a complete greening plan with environmental impact estimates and a professional proposal. SymbioScout democratizes urban planning by making expert-level analysis accessible to community groups."

## Key Talking Points

## Demo Tips

1. **Keep it smooth**: Have the demo sites pre-loaded and ready
2. **Emphasize speed**: Show how quickly results are generated
3. **Highlight AI**: Point out the intelligent recommendations
4. **Show impact**: Make the environmental benefits tangible
5. **End with action**: Demonstrate the proposal export

## Backup Plan

If API calls fail during demo:
- Use pre-generated content
- Explain the AI integration conceptually
- Focus on the user experience and interface
- Emphasize the potential with proper API access

## Questions to Expect

**Q: How accurate are the impact estimates?**
A: "These are conservative estimates based on established research. For production use, we'd refine these with more sophisticated models and local data."

**Q: What about land ownership and permissions?**
A: "The platform provides the data and proposals needed to approach authorities. We include disclaimers about checking ownership and obtaining proper permissions."

**Q: Can this scale to other cities?**
A: "Absolutely. The system is designed to work with different plant databases and can be adapted for any region with suitable mapping data."

**Q: How does the AI work?**
A: "We use OpenAI's API to generate intelligent recommendations based on site characteristics, local climate, and ecological best practices."
